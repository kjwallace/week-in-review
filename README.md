# weekly-review
A living history record of everything we're accomplishing in LabDAO

A new document will be created each week and will be used to create a post on discord in the #week-in-review channel.

These documents/posts serve three functions: providing a concise overview of progress made by our community, collecting information to be used for our monthly newsletter, and creating a historical record of the work accomplished by LabDAO.
