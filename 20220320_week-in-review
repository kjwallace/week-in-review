Technology and projects

1) Niklas has published a new article explaining the two products that LabDAO is developing: openlab exchange and openlab teams. This is essential reading for everyone here! The article is available at https://mirror.xyz/niklasrindtorff.eth/lz_8uK8sStkl8pa35FDCQkCblROeOREn3Y3Tcpl7vVk
2) We hope to start scheming on how to build this. The goal of openlab teams is to allow academics to launch new DAOs that control their IP with a couple mouse clicks. You can contribute to this project here: https://github.com/labdao/openlab_teams
3) Do you know a scientific tool that has a crappy web user interface? We're working on something to improve the user experience for those tools. If you know a useful scientific tool with a crappy web UI, list it here: https://github.com/labdao/gui-wrapper/issues/2 and if you want to help develop and test the current tool look here https://github.com/labdao/gui-wrapper/issues/1
4) If you want to contribute, please know that you're invited to open an issue on our Dework (https://app.dework.xyz/o/labdao-3bt1rpGt1z7a1W2ld7B8oA) or Github. Feel free to share your ideas or interest in contributing to a project!

Community amd coordination

1) We have had some good first proposals for articles, but there are lots of things we'd like to share with the world about LabDAO! Check out more details here: https://github.com/labdao/article/issues â€“ bounties are available!
2) We are establishing a regular cadence for our newsletter and community calls. You can expect our monthly newsletter on the last Friday of each month, and we'll be hosting a community call on the first Monday of each month. The next community call is scheduled for April 4th.
3) Shoutout to our new joiners who have introduced themselves this past week: @dcaksel @plantboi @weitinglin66 @laura-b @robsyme @greg @taylor : we're glad you're here!
